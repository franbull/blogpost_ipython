An IPython notebook showing use of ```interact```

You can see this notebook on [nbviewer.ipython.org](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/franbull/blogpost_ipython/blob/master/Interactive%20Sine%20Plot.ipynb) Although note that the ```interact``` bit only works if you're running the notebook server locally.
